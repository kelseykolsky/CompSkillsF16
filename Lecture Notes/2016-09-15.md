# Notes for 2016-09-15 #
Plan for lecture:

* more on data types

## Objectives
* coding
	* understand indexing
	* Learn to use range() for iterations
	* function definitions
	* understand mutable versus immutable
	* learn useful str, list methods
* concepts
	* call by reference versus call by value
	* mutable versus immutable objects

## Python ##
### Indexing and slices###
use as examples:  nucleotides = ["A","C","G","T","N","Y","U"]

	goodReads=nucleotides[0:4] or goodReads=nucleotides[:4]
	ambiguousReads=nucleotides[4:] or ambiguousReads=nucleotides[4:8]

biggest slice is a copy. very common construction

	nucsCopy=nucleotides[:]

### Reference Versus Value #####
direct assignment of larger objects (like lists) are *references*

* List example

		badCopy=nucleotides

badCopy *is* the nucleotides  *object* (not a new object with the same value)

	badCopy
	badCopy[1]="foobar"
	badCopy
	nucleotides
**if you want a copy of a list, use [:]**

### Mutable Versus Immutable ####
* Lists (and dicts) are mutable
* strings (and tuples) are immutable

		shortSeq="CCCAAAAA"
		shortSeq[3:]="????"

Use string methods instead

	shortSeq=shortSeq.replace("A","?")
	shortSeq

### Example of Function Definition, Abstraction ###

remember, from above

	nucleotides
	goodReads
	ambiguousReads
	
Using 

	sequence="CGCAGCNNYYGCATTUUNAAGCYACTCCGYYCCTGGGGAGTNNNTTGAA"

write function(str, nuclist) to return tuple of counts, *emphasizing stepwise refinement*

	def countNucs(seq, nucs):
		counts=[]
		for nextNuc in nucs:
			counts.append( seq.count(nextNuc) )
		return counts

	countNucs( sequence, nucleotides )

	print( "counting", nucleotides, "in", sequence )
	print( countNucs( sequence, nucleotides ) )
	
	print( "counting", goodReads, "in", sequence )
	print( countNucs( sequence, goodReads ) )
	
	print( "counting", ambiguousReads, "in", sequence )
	print( countNucs( sequence, ambiguousReads ) )

**Notes**

* functions can return *any* object (lists, tuples, strings, even functions) 
* If time permits, play around with adding error to this code
### Useful List Methods ###
* list.sort -- changes the actual object (lists are mutable, show reverse parameter)
* list.append -- see code above
* list.reverse -- exactly what you think
* list.index

		nucleotides.index("A")
		nucleotides[2]
		nucleotides.index("foobar")

Success can be tested

	if nucleotides.index('A'):
    		print("found an A at position", nucleotides.index('A'))

Failure is an exception

	if nucleotides.index('foobar'):
    		print("found an A at position", nucleotides.index('foobar'))

More on exception handing later...
### Casting###

To convert objects *x* of type *a* into object of type *b*: x=b(x)

	seqAsList = list(sequence)
	seqAsList

	range()
	list(range(5))

### Sets ###
Sets are lists with duplicates removed, can be useful

	seqAsSet = set(seqAsList)
	seqAsSet

Sets are iterable, but not indexable

	seqAsSet[2]

	for nextMember in seqAsSet:
		print(nextMember)

can test membership in sets

	"A" in seqAsSet
	"foobar" in seqAsSet
