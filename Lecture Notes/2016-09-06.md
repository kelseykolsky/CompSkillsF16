# Notes for 2016-09-06 #
## Objectives ##

* Checkpoint: Where are we?
* Introduce Python
## Class Housekeeping ##

### Where We Are ###
What should have already done:
* learn to use git
	* understand how desktop and online work together
	* understand how desktop and files on the computer are related 
	* Understand the workflow (branch, edit, commit, sync, merge branches)
* learn basic bash commands
* Understand role of the terminal

### Homework ###
* turn in HW1 when you can, no later than next week, let me know
	* the main objectives are to use git, practice simple bash shell commands 
* Expect HW2 next week (don't fall behind)
### Windows ###
Why do we use Unix? 

What to do if you don't have access to a unix machine?

* Install Anaconda to get python on your machine
	* Unfortunately, I can't help much
* To practice bash: Install a bash emulator, such as win-bash

Windows users in class, please help each other. 

## Python ##

* What is a program? 
* Kinds of programs: interpreted, compiled, in-between

Steps to learning how to program

* Syntax: command by command (iPython is good for this)
* Stand-alone programs: building programs as files (TextWranger is good for this)
* Using other people's code: packages (pandas, matplotlib, e.g.)
* Style: writing **good** code

Most programming is *re-programming*, not creating things from scratch

## iPython (Ch 3) ##
Interactive python "shell". 

1. "variable" assignment: int, float, string, list, tuple

	a. set some variables of each type
2. import numpy as np

### Interacting With iPython ###
1. tab completion
2. introspection (show ? and ??)
### Objects ###
* value
* type: type()

* methods: show dot with tab
