## Getting help
* In the terminal, use man command (hint: man man gives help on man)
* In apps (such as TextWrangler, Terminal, and Safari) click on Help at the top of the screen
* Google is your friend, and copy (ctl-C) and paste (ctl-V) makes it even friendlier
* Check out StackOverflow.com
* in ipython:
	* cmd? gives help for “cmd” (e.g. help? gives help on the help command)
	* cmd?? gives the code for “cmd”
* in python: help(object) gives help on “object” (e.g. help(dict) gives help on dictionaries)
## Miscellaneous tips and tricks
* in Unix
	* up arrow (and down arrow) step through command history
	* tab autocompletes
* In python
	*txt\<tab\> shows possible autocompletions, that is shows possibilities that begin with “txt”
