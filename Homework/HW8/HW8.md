# Homework XXX: ****DRAFT**** 

**NOTE: This is not the actual assignment yet!**

In this assignment gives you will 

* plot data from HW7
* compute some co-variances and correlations

### Readings
1. Read about Matplotlib
2. Work through XXX

## Things to do before beginning of class, **DATE (Lecture XXX)**, or sooner
#### Add Metadata ####
Later, we will look for correlations between microbiome changes and patient metadata.

1. Read *../Resources/vaginal_metadata.txt* into a pandas dataframe 
2. Drop the first three columns (*ID, DATE_COM, and SITE2*)
3. Merge the **first** dataframe from above (the one with a row for each day) with this one, using the patient name as the common field.

	Beware, there may be some rows that don't match up. Again, this is real data, and that sort of thing happens all the time.

4. Add the Shannon and Inverse Simpson indexes for each sample (note: if you aren't using functions, you're doing too much work)


You will XXX

1. do it
2. do this too
3. ...
## Turn in homework

1. Commit your work
2. Update your local master
3. Sync with the remote master (that is how we will turn in homework!).

## Grading
We will grade your homework by XXX
