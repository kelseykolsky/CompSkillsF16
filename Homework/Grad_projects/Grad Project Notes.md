# Guidance for Graduate Student Projects #

Ideally, your project will be something you are actually interested in, such as data that will show up in your thesis, or data from your PI's lab.

##Most successful projects in the past have

* used data in a large table format (such as a tab or comma delimited file exported from Excell, Access, or SQL)
* summarized parts of the data in these tables. Possible examples are
	* grouping one set of values by another (such as snail size by island, or DNA sequence by body site), and summarizing the values
	* doing statistical analysis on the data

## Successful Presentations ##

Students in the class will grade they projects, with input from the instructor and TA.

The best projects:

* clearly state the research question or hypothesis ("what are you talking about?")
* make clear **why** this is interesting ("why should i care?") 
* are relatively short (too many slides is a common mistake)
* have simple slides (too much text is a common mistake)
* present the type of data analyzed, and the kind of analysis done (showing the code is usually a mistake)
* talk about how you used any external modules, why those? (the idea is to leave everyone wanting to look up the module, not to describe the modules in detail)
